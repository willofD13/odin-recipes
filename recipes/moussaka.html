        <ol>
            <li>Peel and slice the potatoes in uniform disks.</li>
            <li>Rinse them under some running water to get rid of the excess starch.</li>
            <li>Slice the eggplants in about the same thickness as the potatoes.</li>
            <li>Rinse them under the water until it comes out clear.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the eggplants and potatoes with some olive oil and season them with a good pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake them in sheet pans in 180 C for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Saute the ground meat in olive oil, onions and garlic.</li>
            <li>Deglaze with some red wine.</li>
            <li>Simmer with chopped tomatoes until thickened.</li>
            <li>Prepare your bechamel sauce. Start my melting the butter.</li>
            <li>Add all of the flour, whisk it until the butter is fully absorbed into the flour and let it cook for a couple of minutes until it slightly browns.</li>
            <li>Turn down the heat to medium and add the milk a little bit at a time. Wait for the milk to absorb into the flour, add some more and repeat until youâ€™ve used all the milk in the recipe. 
                Your bechamel sauce is ready when it has thickened and resembles a custard.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the stove and add the cheese, the nutmeg and two teaspoons of salt.</li>
            <li>Whisk until combined, taste your bechamel and add one more teaspoon of salt if it still tastes bland.</li>
            <li>Finally add your egg yolks and quickly whisk so the eggs fully incorporate in the mixture.</li>
        </ol>
